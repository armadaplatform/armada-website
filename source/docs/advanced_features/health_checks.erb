    <h3>Health-checks.</h3>
    <p>
    Health-checks are simple scripts which inform us about status of our service. They are running inside the service's container
    and report its status to Armada agent. You can see it in 'Status' column of <span class="inline-name">armada list</span> command.
    </p>
    <ul class="text">
        <li>
        <span class="inline-name">passing</span> - everything works!
        </li>
         <li>
        <span class="inline-name">warning</span> - service works, but there's something wrong with it (e.g.: a lot of errors being logged).
        </li>
         <li>
        <span class="inline-name">critical</span> - service doesn't work! Armada won't use its address in any load-balancer until the status changes back to <span class="inline-name">passing</span> or <span class="inline-name">warning</span>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Default health-check</h4>
    <p>
    Every service based on <span class="inline-name">microservice</span> image has a default health-check which checks whether port 80 inside the container is open.
    If it is, we assume the service works and return '<span class="inline-name">passing</span>' status. Otherwise '<span class="inline-name">critical</span>' is returned.
    You can disable it in Dockerfile with one line:</p>
    <br/><span class="inline-name">RUN rm -rf /opt/microservice/health-checks</span>


    <h4>Custom health-checks</h4>
    <p>In order to add a health-check to your service, simply create health-checks directory in your project and add your health-checks there. There are some things you should know:</p>
    <ul class="text">
        <li>
        <b>shebangs:</b> Since you can write your health check in any language you want,
            remember to add a shebang to let a system know how to run your script.
            For example for python health-check you'd add <span class="inline-name">#!/usr/bin/env python</span>.
        </li>
        <br/>
         <li>
        <b>exit codes:</b> Health-checks report their status by exiting with an integer code. 0 means <span class="inline-name">passing</span>, 1 means <span class="inline-name">warning</span> and 2 means <span class="inline-name">critical</span>.
        </li>
        <br/>
         <li>
        <b>the worst outcome:</b> Each health-check script can return a different status. Final service's status is "the worst" of all statuses.
             So if you have 10 health checks, 9 of them exit with code 0 (<span class="inline-name">passing</span>),
             and one exits with code 2 (<span class="inline-name">critical</span>) your service's final status will be <span class="inline-name">critical</span>.
        </li>
        <br/>
    </ul>

    <h4>Example</h4>
    <p>
    Instead of providing some dummy example, we suggest you check out <a href="https://github.com/armadaplatform/mysql/blob/master/health-checks/mysql-ok">armada mysql repository</a>
    to see how custom health-checks can be used in real life.
    <br/>
    As you can see, we're logging <i>"Error. MySQL is not running."</i> information.
    This is message will be visible in service's health-checks logs, which, in case of mysql service, you can see either by
    running <span class="inline-name">armada diagnose mysql</span> command,
    or by reading health-checks logs file: <span class="inline-name">armada ssh mysql tail /var/log/supervisor/run_health_checks*</span>
    </p>
